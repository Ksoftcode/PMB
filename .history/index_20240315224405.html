                <h1>ILORIN : WHERE IT BEGAN</h1>
                <p>
                    Princess & Moyosore’s life and career grew out of deep windy city roots. From their childhood in the south community of Ilorin, through their first contact in Chapel Secondary School in 2004 and 2002 respectively with missionary standards where they became friends. In April, 2015, they began to plan a future together in which Moyosore was already a graduate architect and Princess had just completed her nursing program.
                </p>
            <br>
                <h1>A PROMISE : THE ROYAL WEDDING </h1>
                <p>
                    On April 20th, 2019, Princess & Moyosore got wedded which was a beautiful coincidence with moyosores 27th birthday at the International Convention Centre (ICC), Rhema Chapel Headquarters, Ilorin, Kwara State. Princess & Moyosore pledged a vow of a lifetime commitment built on Godly Christian principles and unswerving adventure.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>EDUCATION : A PRIORITY / STANDARD</h1>
                <p>
                    The union of Princess & Moyosore established a standard of continuous learning, unlearning and relearning through education. Princess proceeded for her pediatric nursing training at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital in 2018/2019 where by the grace of God she emerged the overall best student for the pediatrics post basic examination in Nigeria. 
                    </p>
                    <p>                    
                    Moyosore also enrolled for his post graduate program in Federal University of Technology Akure where he also finished with honors. Subsequently, PMB proceeded for further studies. Moyosore bagged a diploma in the Business of Architecture from the European School of Economics. He further enrolled for an MSc in Architecture at University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Kwara State.
                    </p>
                    <p>                    
                    Princess completed a five (5) years nursing degree from the National Open University of Nigeria with honors. Afterwards, she proceeded for her master’s degree in maternal and child health nursing at Babcock University in 2022. These achievements were constantly stirred by a burning desire to attain the zenith of their profession, where no one is left behind.

                <p>
                    Princess shared her vision with Moyosore in 2015 on changing the narrative and perception of Nigerian nurses through a revolutionized appearance and the inclusivity of informatics in nursing education and practice. The company was birth in April 2016 at a small property equipped with machines and experienced staff. The company has since grown with offices in Ilorin and Lagos with a worldwide distribution network.

                <p>
                    Princess & Moyosore registered MB Architects limited in August 2017 with both of them as the company’s director.

They took up roles and responsibilities in ensuring a good service delivery and ensuring nothing was left undone in the absence of one of them.

                <p>
                    EPMB was conceived by Princess & Moyosore out of passion to redefine how people live and work. It is important to integrate this two in a symphonic way in other to get the best out of life. One brand, many companies, and many, many people – that’s us in a nutshell. Spread all over the world, we have a passion for home/office furnishing and an inspiring shared vision: to create a better everyday life for the many people. </p>
                    
                    <p>This, together with our straightforward business idea, shared values, and a culture based on the spirit of togetherness, guides us in everything we do. To offer a wide range of well-designed, functional home  & office furnishing products at prices so low, that as many people as possible will be able to afford them.</p>
                    
                    <p> EPMB approach to design focuses on how the aesthetics and organisation of a space can reflect the brand, improve efficiency and productivity, increase employee satisfaction and support sustainability using space, colour, materials and light as tools to create healthy, uplifting environments.</p>
                <br>
                <h1> THE EPMB POINT OF VIEW </h1>
                <p>
                    As a global business with the capacity to make a large impact, we know that we have a responsibility to make that impact a positive one. At EPMB, we believe good business means ethical business. Learn where we stand on important issues by following :-
                    <p>
                    <strong> AIR POLLUTION -</strong> people around the world underestimate the threat of air pollution in their homes. In reality, indoor air pollution causes more premature deaths than outdoor pollution. EPMB wants to raise awareness around air pollution. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution is estimated to kill 1 in 8 people globally, due to heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease and cancer. That’s why giving people access to clean air is a priority at EPMB.</p>
                    <p>
                    We are focusing on reducing air pollution from our own operations and products. We are phasing out hazardous chemicals and tackling greenhouse gas emissions. We have also successfully lowered formaldehyde emissions in our wooden furniture and removed harmful flame-retardants from textiles to improve indoor air quality in our customers' homes. Our next step is engaging with people around the topic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>BIO-DIVERSITY -</strong> EPMB recognises that the world is experiencing a biodiversity crisis. Dramatic loss of species, ecosystems and genetic diversity is human-induced and represents, together with climate change, one of the greatest challenges of our time. Biodiversity is vital for a healthy and resilient world, and for human health and wellbeing. EPMB is dependent on biodiversity for the success of our business, now and in the future. </p>
                    <p>
                    The EPMB business is already today experiencing business implications influenced by biodiversity loss. We also recognise that biodiversity loss is a complex challenge. As with climate change, EPMB has a unique opportunity and responsibility to take action to both reduce our impact and contribute to positive outcomes. We don’t have all the answers and will work collaboratively together with others to support the large global movements needed to reverse nature loss in this decade.</p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>CIRCULARITY -</strong> EPMB is embarking on a transformation journey to become a circular business by 2030. In the world of finite resources, we have recognised the need to change our approach to how and where we meet our customers, how and what products and services we develop, how we source materials and develop the EPMB supply chain. We are adapting our existing business model to enable the prolongation of product and material life, by enabling the four circular loops of reuse, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling.</p>
                    <p> 
                    One of the key enablers of circularity for EPMB is to design all products with circular capabilities from the beginning. Our products will always live up to the five dimensions of the foundation of democratic design, bringing good design to the many people by providing well-designed home / office furnishing solutions, with great form and function, high quality, built with a focus on sustainability, and at an affordable price. We will now also embed circular capabilities into every product, setting the preconditions for all products to live multiple lives as they move through the circular loops.

                <h1>THE CUTTING EDGE</h1>
                <p>
                    Since Princess & Moyosore are already in the business of architecture- building modern houses & Offices. This is a role they have embarked on together for 6 years having started in 2017. They have a platform to change & redefine how people should live & work.
